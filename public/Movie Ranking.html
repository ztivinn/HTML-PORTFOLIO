 <h1>The Best Movies According to Steven</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Back to future</h3>
 <p>One of my favorite movies that I saw during the pandemic, since for its time the effects were very good.</p>
 <h3>Sipderman Into the Spiderverse</h3>
 <p>The best animated film I've ever seen, 
 as it has the most realistic effects<br/>
 I've ever seen and the story is very good.</p>
<h3>Grown Ups</h3>
<p>One of my favorite comedy movies, when I want to have a few laughs with friends or family.<br/>
Besides, I always think that when I grow up, I want to have a life like this.</p>

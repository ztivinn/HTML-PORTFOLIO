<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated with a bachelor's degree in International Business and Administration. I have worked in various professional roles, including as a logistics assistant and my own business, selling imported products.</p>

<p>However, I've taken on a new challenge, venturing into web development. To acquire new skills, as we live in an environment of constant change and where the digital age is taking center stage.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to mention that I am a very committed person to learning, since I consider myself someone who wants to learn new things and be able to teach others.</p>
